# IMT 549 Final Project

## The Project
Hello, my name is Alyssa Gates, and this site is a list of my favorite books. Here you can find books ranging in reading level and genre, which have inspired me and brought me joy. I hope they can bring some inspiration and joy to your life too! If this is too grand a task to accomplish, I hope this list can at least provide a spark of amusement in your Sunday afternoon or just a moment with a good book.

## Why My Favorite Books?
I chose the topic of my favorite books because I would like to own a bookstore one day. I thought this could be a place to share book recommendations based on my favorites, my current reads, and some of the books that have brought me joy over the years so I can share that joy with other people.
